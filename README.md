## Goal ##

Simplification and ease-of-use of a ticket management service. This project aims to mimic TicketMaster but on a smaller scale for local businesses and events. We aim to provide clear authentication of registered events and tickets.

## Why is our project needed? ##

This is needed to help customers get tickets ahead of time without worrying about being late. It also helps local event coordinators to sell tickets to their potential buyers and customers for small-scale events. In terms of tickets, it helps any facilitator to keep track of event popularity, and ticket management.
